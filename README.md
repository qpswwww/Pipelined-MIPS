## Project Info

**the Experiment of the Principles of Computer Organizaton**

**Supervisor:** Aiping Xu

## Project Description

- In this project, I implemented a simple 5-stage pipelined processor using the MIPS ISA, which supported “bypass” and “stall”. 

- The final product was tested by Modelsim and Xilinx Artix-7.
